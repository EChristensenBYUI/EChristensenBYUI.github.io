        <h2>Target Audience</h2>

        <p>The Target Audience for this site will be members of the community for the three towns, Preston, Soda Springs, Fish Haven. This is primarily a weather site, but since the weather so often affects every day activities and events, this is also a site to display upcoming events and other community announcements. </p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <h3>Delilah</h3>
        <p>Delilah is a 20 year old online student living in Preston. She is working toward a degree in accounting, but in her spare time she likes to sew. She works at an ice cream shop while she is going to school.</p>
        <h3>John</h3>
        <p>John is 40 years old and works as a manager of an italian restaurant. He lives in Soda Springs. He's married to a woman named Ellen and they have three children. John's Mother, Irene, also lives in the area, in Fish Haven. </p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Renaissance Fair</h3>
        <p>In the early summer there is a renaissance fair. Delilah has sewn her outfit, but she must know what the weather will be like so she knows if she needs to make some kind of overcoat- a modern-day jacket would spoil her outfit!</p>
        <h3>Picnic Plans</h3>
        <p>John's anniversary is coming up, and he would like to surprise his wife with a picnic. Their anniversary is in the spring, when it's always hard to tell which days will be nice and which ones will still be chilly, to see if he needs to come up with alternate plans. </p>
        <h3>Catering</h3>
        <p>There are many events going on in this area. John frequently checks this page to see when events coming up in an attempt to advertise catering options from his restaurant.</p>
        <h3>Ice Cream</h3>
        <p>The ice cream shop Delilah works at is very close to a park. The weather has a big impact on how many customers come in. Delilah wants to check the weather for the upcoming weekend to see if she could take time off to study for an upcoming test. If it will be chilly, her manager would probably let her take the afternoon off. But if it's going to  be nice outside she will definitely need to work, and cram for her test some other time.</p>
        <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
        <p>John has promised his wife some time to herself. She prefers to stay at home, so he needs to come up with somewhere to take the kids. He could just take is teenage kids to the movies, but he'd rather see if there are any interesting events going on, they spend far too much time in front of screens anyway. </p>
